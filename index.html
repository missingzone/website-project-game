    <p class="text">As a team we started the project using Figma. We used Figma to throw ideas at each other and to see what works best. Once we had created a digram that showed the base of the game and how it would work, we made a Trello to organzine a list on what needs to be done to best navigate when creating the game. Once we had a plan to follow we used Replit to collectively create the code so we could all see and edit the code together.
    <p class="text"> Starting the project in figma really helped us to create the base of the game we wanted. We were able add ideas and collectively choose what we wanted in the game. 
    <p class="text">We could see the layout of the game which helped to plan the to-do lists in Trello.</p> 
    <p class="text"> Using replit was a great way to collectively write code together and have good communications between our team members. We were able to effectively problem solve together and find any errors in the game and make it work how we wanted it to.</p>

<h2 class="hand">What we would do differently</h2>
<p class="text center"> Towards the end of the project we were running out of time to finish the game so that it works without any problems. Giving more time to write code would help to finish on time, so better time management for writing the code would have been useful. 
<p class="text center">Adding more levels within the game would have greatly improved the users experience, making the game harder to complete.</p>
<p class="text center">Using replit was great for communicating between team members, but struggled to show some of the errors that might occur in visual code studio. Finding appropriate software for collective coding would have helped us out a lot.</p>
